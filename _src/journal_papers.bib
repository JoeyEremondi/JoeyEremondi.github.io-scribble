abstract = "The complexity and decidability of various decision problems involving the shuffle operation (denoted by ⧢) are studied. The following three problems are all shown to be NP-complete: given a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) M, and two words u and v, is L(M)⊈u⧢v, is u⧢v⊈L(M), and is L(M)≠u⧢v? It is also shown that there is a polynomial-time algorithm to determine, for NFAs M1,M2, and a deterministic pushdown automaton M3, whether L(M1)⧢L(M2)⊆L(M3). The same is true when M1,M2,M3 are one-way nondeterministic l-reversal-bounded k-counter machines, with M3 being deterministic. Other decidability and complexity results are presented for testing whether given languages L1,L2, and R from various languages families satisfy L1⧢L2⊆R, and R⊆L1⧢L2. Several closure results on shuffle are also shown."

abstract = "Several insertion operations are studied applied to languages accepted by one-way and two-way deterministic reversal-bounded multicounter machines. These operations are defined by the ideals obtained from relations such as the prefix, infix, suffix, and outfix relations, as well as operations defined from inverses of a type of deterministic transducer with reversal-bounded counters attached. The question of whether the resulting languages can always be accepted by deterministic machines with the same number (or larger number) of input-turns (resp., counters, counter-reversals, etc.) is investigated."

    abstract = { A language L is said to be dense if every word in the universe is an infix of some word in L. This notion has been generalized from the infix operation to arbitrary word operations ϱ in place of the infix operation (ϱ-dense, with infix-dense being the standard notion of dense). It is shown here that it is decidable, for a language L accepted by a one-way nondeterministic reversal-bounded pushdown automaton, whether L is infix-dense. However, it becomes undecidable for both deterministic pushdown automata (with no reversal-bound), and for nondeterministic one-counter automata. When examining suffix-density, it is undecidable for more restricted families such as deterministic one-counter automata that make three reversals on the counter, but it is decidable with less reversals. Other decidability results are also presented on dense languages, and contrasted with a marked version called ϱ-marked-density. Also, new languages are demonstrated to be outside various deterministic language families after applying different deletion operations from smaller families. Lastly, bounded-dense languages are defined and examined. }

abstract = "It is shown that one-way deterministic reversal-bounded multicounter languages are closed under right quotient with languages from many language families; even those defined by nondeterministic machines such as the context-free languages. Also, it is shown that when starting with one-way deterministic machines with one counter that makes only one reversal, taking the left quotient with languages from many different language families — again including those defined by nondeterministic machines such as the context-free languages — yields only one-way deterministic reversal-bounded multicounter languages. These results are surprising given the nondeterministic nature of the deletion. However, if there are two more reversals on the counter, or a second 1-reversal-bounded counter, taking the left quotient (or even just the suffix operation) yields languages that can neither be accepted by deterministic reversal-bounded multi-counter machines, nor by 2-way deterministic machines with one reversal-bounded counter."
