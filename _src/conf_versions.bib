abstract="Several insertion operations are studied applied to languages accepted by one-way and two-way deterministic reversal-bounded multicounter machines. These operations are defined by the ideals obtained from relations such as the prefix, infix, suffix and outfix relations. The insertion of regular languages and other languages into deterministic reversal-bounded multicounter languages is also studied. The question of whether the resulting languages can always be accepted by deterministic machines with the same number of turns on the input tape, the same number of counters, and reversals on the counters is investigated. In addition, the question of whether they can always be accepted by increasing either the number of input tape turns, counters, or counter reversals is addressed. The results in this paper form a complete characterization based on these parameters. Towards these new results, we use a technique for simultaneously showing a language cannot be accepted by both one-way deterministic reversal-bounded multicounter machines, and by two-way deterministic machines with one reversal-bounded counter.",

abstract="The complexity and decidability of various decision problems involving the shuffle operation (denoted by ) are studied.

It is also shown that there is a polynomial-time algorithm to determine, for {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf{\{}NFA{\}}{\$}{\$}s {\$}{\$}M{\_}1, M{\_}2{\$}{\$}and a deterministic pushdown automaton {\$}{\$}M{\_}3{\$}{\$}, whether .

abstract="A language L is said to be dense if every word in the universe is an infix of some word in L. This notion has been generalized from the infix operation to arbitrary word operations {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varrho {\$}{\$}ϱin place of the infix operation ({\$}{\$}{\backslash}varrho {\$}{\$}ϱ-dense, with infix-dense being the standard notion of dense). It is shown here that it is decidable, for a language L accepted by a one-way nondeterministic reversal-bounded pushdown automaton, whether L is infix-dense. However, it becomes undecidable for both deterministic pushdown automata (with no reversal-bound), and for nondeterministic one-counter automata. When examining suffix-density, it is undecidable for more restricted families such as deterministic one-counter automata that make three reversals on the counter, but it is decidable with less reversals. Other decidability results are also presented on dense languages, and contrasted with a marked version called {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varrho {\$}{\$}ϱ-marked-density. Also, new languages are demonstrated to be outside various deterministic language families after applying different deletion operations from smaller families. Lastly, bounded-dense languages are defined and examined.",

abstract="Many different deletion operations are investigated applied to languages accepted by one-way and two-way deterministic reversal-bounded multicounter machines as well as finite automata. Operations studied include the prefix, suffix, infix and outfix operations, as well as left and right quotient with languages from different families. It is often expected that language families defined from deterministic machines will not be closed under deletion operations. However, here, it is shown that one-way deterministic reversal-bounded multicounter languages are closed under right quotient with languages from many different language families; even those defined by nondeterministic machines such as the context-free languages, or languages accepted by nondeterministic pushdown machines augmented by any number of reversal-bounded counters. Also, it is shown that when starting with one-way deterministic machines with one counter that makes only one reversal, taking the left quotient with languages from many different language families, again including those defined by nondeterministic machines such as the context-free languages, yields only one-way deterministic reversal-bounded multicounter languages (by increasing the number of counters). However, if there are even just two more reversals on the counter, or a second 1-reversal-bounded counter, taking the left quotient (or even just the suffix operation) yields languages that can neither be accepted by deterministic reversal-bounded multicounter machines, nor by 2-way nondeterministic machines with one reversal-bounded counter. A number of other results with deletion operations are also shown.",
