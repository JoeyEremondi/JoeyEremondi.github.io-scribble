My paper "Approximate Normalization for Gradual Dependent Types", with Ã‰ric Tanter and Ron Garcia, was accepted to ICFP!
The [preprint is now available on Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06469).
Feel free to send me comments or questions on the paper.

I'm currently working on extending the calculus from that paper into a fully usable language,
which I've named [Dudley](https://github.com/dudley-lang/). Stay tuned for more updates on this development!
