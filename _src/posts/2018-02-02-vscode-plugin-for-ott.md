I've made a package that integrates the [Ott Semantic Modeling tool](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/ott/) into Visual Studio Code. Right now, it supports syntax highlighting, and showing error messages inline, but I hope to eventually add support for source formatting, and prettifying symbols.

You can view the package [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JoeyEremondi.ott).

Pull requests, collaboration, suggestions are all welcome!
